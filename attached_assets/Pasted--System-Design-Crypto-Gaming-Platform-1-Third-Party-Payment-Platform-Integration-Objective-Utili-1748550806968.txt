System Design: Crypto Gaming Platform
1. Third-Party Payment Platform Integration
Objective: Utilize a third-party payment platform to handle all financial transactions, ensuring security and scalability.

Implementation:

Deposit & Withdrawal:

Users initiate deposits and withdrawals through the gaming platform.

The platform communicates with the third-party payment API to process transactions.

Upon successful transactions, the third-party platform updates the user's balance accordingly.

Balance Management:

The gaming platform queries the third-party payment platform to retrieve real-time user balances.

All financial records are maintained by the third-party platform, ensuring consistency and security.

Benefits:

Security: Offloading financial transactions to a specialized platform reduces the risk of vulnerabilities.

Scalability: The third-party platform can handle high volumes of transactions efficiently.

Compliance: Ensures adherence to financial regulations and standards.

2. User Nickname Functionality
Objective: Allow users to set and display custom nicknames within the gaming platform for personalization and identification.

Implementation:

Nickname Setting:

Upon registration or within the user profile settings, users can set a unique nickname.

The platform validates the uniqueness of the nickname to prevent duplicates.

Display:

Nicknames are displayed in-game, on leaderboards, and in user profiles.

This enhances user engagement and personalization.

Benefits:

User Engagement: Personalized nicknames foster a sense of identity and community.

Anonymity: Users can choose nicknames that don't reveal personal information, ensuring privacy.

3. Google Login Integration
Objective: Provide users with the option to register and log in using their Google accounts for a seamless onboarding experience.

Implementation:

Authentication Flow:

Integrate Google's OAuth 2.0 for authentication.

Upon user consent, retrieve basic profile information (e.g., name, email).

Create or link the user's gaming account with the Google account.

Security Measures:

Implement token validation and secure storage of authentication tokens.

Regularly refresh tokens to maintain session security.

Benefits:

User Convenience: Simplifies the registration and login process.

Security: Leverages Google's robust authentication mechanisms.

Reduced Friction: Lowers barriers to entry, encouraging more users to join.

🔄 User Flow Scenarios
Normal Scenario:

User Registration:

User chooses to register using Google login.

Sets a unique nickname during the registration process.

Deposit:

Initiates a deposit of 5 USDT through the gaming platform.

Transaction is processed by the third-party payment platform.

User's balance is updated accordingly.

Gameplay:

Joins a Rock-Paper-Scissors game with a 5 USDT stake.

Matched with another player with the same stake.

Wins the game; platform deducts a 5% fee (0.5 USDT).

9.5 USDT is credited to the user's balance.

Withdrawal:

Initiates a withdrawal of 9.5 USDT.

Transaction is processed by the third-party payment platform.

Funds are transferred to the user's wallet.

Exceptional Scenario:

Withdrawal to Unrecognized Wallet:

User attempts to withdraw funds to a different wallet address.

Platform detects the mismatch and blocks the transaction.

User is prompted to contact support for resolution.

```

*Clients* talk to a central API Gateway, which routes and enforces auth. Core services handle user/profile, payments, game logic, immutable ledger, and notifications. Data persistence uses PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis/Kafka for pub/sub, and a BSC node plus Chainlink VRF for on-chain randomness.\*

## 2. Data Flow Descriptions

### 2.1 Deposit Flow

1. **Initiation**: Client → `POST /api/v1/payments/deposit` { userId, amount, currency }
2. **Third‑Party API Call**: Payment Service calls external PCI‑compliant API. Returns transactionId.
3. **Webhook**: Third‑party → `POST /api/v1/payments/callback` { transactionId, status }
4. **Reconciliation**: Callback writes to Ledger Service → Transaction record (requested, succeeded).
5. **Balance Update**: Ledger Service emits event → User Service updates cached balance.
6. **Notification**: Notification Service pushes toast/push → Client.

### 2.2 Join Game & Matchmaking

1. **Request Match**: Client → `POST /api/v1/games/match` { userId, gameType, stake }
2. **Queue**: Game Engine enqueues request in Redis/Kafka topic.
3. **Match**: Engine polls topic, finds peer with same stake.
4. **Session**: Engine spins up a match session, reserves stake via Ledger Service.
5. **Client Notification**: Engine → Notification Service → informs both clients of match found.

### 2.3 Gameplay & Settlement

1. **Move Submission**: Clients → `POST /api/v1/games/{matchId}/move` { userId, move }
2. **Evaluate**: Game Engine collects both moves, applies rules, determines winner.
3. **Randomness (if needed)**: For games like hangman, Engine requests VRF from Chainlink.
4. **Settlement**: Engine calls Ledger Service to deduct loser stake, add winner minus fee.
5. **History Log**: Ledger writes immutable record. User Service updates stats.
6. **Notify**: Notification Service broadcasts result.

### 2.4 Withdraw Flow

1. **Initiation**: Client → `POST /api/v1/payments/withdraw` { userId, amount, walletAddress }
2. **Verification**: Payment Service validates address vs. user record.
3. **Ledger Reservation**: Ledger marks withdrawal pending.
4. **Third‑Party Payout**: Payment Service calls external API.
5. **Callback**: Third‑party → `/api/v1/payments/callback` resolves status.
6. **Finalize**: Ledger marks success/failure, updates balance.
7. **Notify**: Client informed of completion.
